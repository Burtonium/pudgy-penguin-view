This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## Tech stack:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)

## Getting Started

To deploy your Next.js project, you can follow these simple steps:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of your Next.js project.

3. Install the project dependencies by running the following command:

```
npm install
```

4. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the Next.js development server and your project will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

5. You can now make changes to your project and see the updates in real-time as you save the files.

6. When you are ready to deploy your project, you can build the production-ready version by running the following command:

```
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized build of your Next.js project in the `./out` directory.

7. Finally, you can deploy your project to your preferred hosting platform. You can refer to the deployment guides provided by Next.js for more information on deploying to platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or Docker.

Remember to configure any necessary environment variables and deployment settings specific to your hosting platform.
